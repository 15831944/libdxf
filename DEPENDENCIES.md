# Dependencies

Building libdxf from scratch, either from a tarball or from the git
repository, requires (at least):

- [automake-1.11](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)

- [autoconf-2.65[(https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html)

- [gcc-4.4.5](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

- [glibc-2.12.2](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)

And for generating documentation:

- [doxygen-1.7.3](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)

- [xmlto-0.0.23](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Xmlto)

and any other dependency these packages may require.

YMMV with lesser version numbers, these are the minimum versions I use to
develop libdxf with.
