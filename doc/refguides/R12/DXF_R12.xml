    <section>
      <title>AutoCAD Release 12 DXF Format.</title>

      <para>AutoCAD can be used by itself as a complete drawing editor.</para>

      <para>In some applications, however, other programs must examine
      drawings created by AutoCAD or generate drawings to be viewed, modified,
      or plotted with AutoCAD.</para>

      <para>For example, if you've made an architectural drawing with AutoCAD,
      using inserted parts to represent windows, doors, and so on, you can
      process the drawing file and produce a bill of materials of all items
      used in the drawing, or even make energy-use calculations based on the
      area and the number and type of windows used.</para>

      <para>Another possible application is to use AutoCAD to describe
      structures and then send the descriptions to a more powerful computer
      for finite-element structural analysis.</para>

      <para>You can compute stresses and displacements and send back
      information to display the deformed structure as an AutoCAD drawing.
      Since the AutoCAD drawing database (.dwg file) is written in a compact
      format that changes significantly as new features are added to AutoCAD,
      we do not document its format and do not recommend that you attempt to
      write programs to read it directly.</para>

      <para>To assist in interchanging drawings between AutoCAD and other
      programs, a Drawing Interchange file format (DXF) has been
      defined.</para>

      <para>All implementations of AutoCAD accept this format and are able to
      convert it to and from their internal drawing file
      representation.</para>

      <para>AutoCAD also supports the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification
      (IGES) file format.</para>

      <para>The information comprising an AutoCAD drawing can be written out
      in IGES format, and IGES files can be read and converted to the AutoCAD
      internal format.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>ASCII Drawing Interchange (DXF) Files.</title>

      <para>This section describes the AutoCAD DXF (drawing interchange file)
      format and the commands provided to read and write these files.</para>

      <para>DXF files are standard ASCII text files.</para>

      <para>They can easily be translated to the formats of other CAD systems
      or submitted to other programs for specialized analysis.</para>

      <para>AutoCAD can also produce or read a binary form of the full DXF
      file.</para>

      <para>This feature is described in detail later in this chapter.</para>

      <section>
        <title>DXFOUT Command - Writing a DXF File.</title>

        <para>You can generate a drawing interchange file from an existing
        drawing by means of the DXFOUT command:</para>

        <programlisting>Command: dxfout</programlisting>

        <para>When AutoCAD prompts you, respond with a filename or press 5 to
        accept the default.</para>

        <para>The default name for the output file is the same as that of the
        current drawing, but with a file type of .dxf.</para>

        <para>If you specify an explicit filename, you do not need to include
        a file type; .dxf is assumed. If a file with the same name already
        exists, the existing file is deleted.</para>

        <para>If you specify the file using a file dialogue box, and a file
        with the same name already exists, AutoCAD tells you; allowing you to
        OK or cancel the deletion.</para>

        <para>Next, DXFOUT asks what precision you want for floating-point
        numbers and permits output of a partial DXF file containing only
        selected objects.</para>

        <programlisting>Enter decimal places of accuracy (0 to 16)/Entities/Binary &lt;6&gt;:</programlisting>

        <para>The Binary option is described later in this chapter.</para>

        <para>If you respond with "entities" (or just "e"), DXFOUT asks you to
        select the objects you want written to the DXF file.</para>

        <para>Only the objects you select are included in the output file -
        symbol tables (including Block Definitions) will not be
        included.</para>

        <para>Once you've selected the desired objects, AutoCAD again prompts
        you for the numeric precision:</para>

        <programlisting>Enter decimal places of accuracy (0 to 16)/Binary &lt;6&gt;:</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>DXFIN Command - Loading a DXF File.</title>

        <para>A drawing interchange file can be converted into an AutoCAD
        drawing by means of the DXFIN command:</para>

        <programlisting>Command: dxfin</programlisting>

        <para>When AutoCAD prompts you, respond with the name of the drawing
        interchange file to be loaded.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Full DXFIN.</title>

          <para>To load a complete DXF file, you must use DXFIN in an empty
          drawing, before any entities have been drawn and before any
          additional Block definitions, layers, linetypes, text styles,
          dimension styles, named views, named coordinate systems, or named
          viewport configurations have been created.<note>
              <para>If the drawing you are using as a prototype is not empty,
              you might find it helpful to open a new drawing using the No
              Prototype... button of the Create New Drawing dialogue box, as
              described in chapter 4 of the "AutoCAD Reference Manual".</para>

              <para>You should also be aware that some third-party
              applications include an acad.lsp or .mnl file that modifies your
              drawing upon startup.</para>
            </note>If any errors are detected during the input, the new
          drawing is discarded.</para>

          <para>Otherwise, an automatic ZOOM All is performed to set the
          drawing extents.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Partial DXFIN.</title>

          <para>If the current drawing is not empty, DXFIN loads only the
          ENTITIES section of the DXF file, adding the entities found there to
          the current drawing.</para>

          <para>In this case, DXFIN displays the message:<programlisting>Not a new drawing -- only ENTITIES section will be input.</programlisting>If
          errors are detected during such partial DXF input, the drawing is
          returned to the state it was in before the DXFIN command.</para>

          <para>Otherwise, the newly added entities are drawn.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Auditing DXF Files.</title>

          <para>To ensure that corrupt data is not imported into your drawing,
          you can instruct AutoCAD to perform an audit after importing DXF
          files into your drawing with DXFIN.</para>

          <para>When you use DXFIN, the default action is to perform no
          automatic auditing.</para>

          <para>To activate automatic auditing, use the CONFIG command:</para>

          <programlisting>Command: config</programlisting>

          <para>Your current AutoCAD configuration appears.</para>

          <para>Press 5 to continue.</para>

          <para>From the Configuration menu select this option:</para>

          <programlisting>7. Configure operating parameters</programlisting>

          <para>From the Operating parameter menu select this option:</para>

          <programlisting>9. Automatic Audit after IGESIN, DXFIN, or DXBIN</programlisting>

          <para>Answer Y to this question:</para>

          <programlisting>Do you want an automatic audit after IGESIN, DXFIN, or DXBIN?
&lt;N&gt;: y</programlisting>

          <para>Return to the graphics screen by pressing 5 three times.<note>
              <para>This kind of audit only displays the errors AutoCAD finds;
              it does not correct them.</para>

              <para>To correct problems, use the AUDIT command on the drawing
              while you are in AutoCAD, or manually edit the DXF file.</para>
            </note></para>
