    <title>DXF Reference.</title>

    <section>
      <title>DXF Format.</title>

      <section>
        <title>About the DXF Format (DXF).</title>

        <para>The DXF<superscript>TM</superscript> format is a tagged data
        representation of all the information contained ® in an AutoCAD
        drawing file. Tagged data means that each data element in the file is
        preceded by an integer number that is called a group code. A group
        code's value indicates what type of data element follows. This value
        also indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object (or
        record) type. Virtually all user-specified information in a drawing
        file can be represented in DXF format.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>About DXF Formatting Conventions.</title>

        <para>Each group code listed in the DXF reference topics is presented
        by a numeric group code value and a description. All group codes can
        apply to DXFTM files, applications (AutoLISP or ObjectARX), or both.
        When the description of a code is different for applications and DXF
        files (or applies to only one or the other), the description is
        preceded by the following indicators:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">APP.</emphasis> Application-specific
            description.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">DXF.</emphasis> DXF file-specific
            description.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>If the description is common to both DXF files and applications,
        no indicator is provided.</para>

        <para>Optional codes are indicated as “optional” in the
        description.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>About Object and Entity Codes (DXF).</title>

        <para>In the DXF<superscript>TM</superscript> format, the definition
        of objects differs from entities: objects have no graphical
        representation and entities do. For example, dictionaries are objects,
        and not entities. Entities are also referred to as graphical objects
        while objects are referred to as nongraphical objects.</para>

        <para>Entities appear in both the BLOCK and ENTITIES sections of the
        DXF file. The use of group codes in the two sections is
        identical.</para>

        <para>Some group codes that define an entity always appear; others are
        optional and appear only if their values differ from the
        defaults.</para>

        <para>Do not write programs that rely on the order given here. The end
        of an entity is indicated by the next 0 group, which begins the next
        entity or indicates the end of the section.<note>
            <para>Accommodating DXF files from future releases of AutoCAD will
            be easier if you write your DXF processing program in a
            table-driven way, ignore undefined group codes, and make no
            assumptions about the order of group codes in an entity. With each
            new AutoCAD release, new group codes will be added to entities to
            accommodate additional features.</para>
          </note></para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Group Code Value Types Reference (DXF).</title>

        <para>Group codes define the type of the associated value as an
        integer, a floating-point number, or a string, according to the
        following table of group code ranges.<table align="left">
