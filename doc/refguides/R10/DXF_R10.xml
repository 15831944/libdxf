    <title>Introduction.</title>

    <section>
      <title>Drawing Interchange and File Formats.</title>

      <para>AutoCAD can be used by itself as a complete drawing editor.</para>

      <para>In some applications, however, other programs must examine
      drawings created by AutoCAD or generate drawings to be viewed, modified,
      or plotted with AutoCAD.</para>

      <para>For example, if you've made an architectural drawing with AutoCAD,
      using INSERTed parts to represent windows, doors, and so on, you can
      process the drawing file and produce a bill of materials of all the
      items used in the drawing, or even make energy use calculations based on
      the area and the number and type of windows used.</para>

      <para>Another possible application is to use AutoCAD to describe
      structures that are then sent to a large computer for finite element
      structural analysis.</para>

      <para>You can compute stresses and displacements and send back
      information to display the deformed structure as an AutoCAD
      drawing.</para>

      <para>Since the AutoCAD drawing database (.dwg file) is written in a
      very compact format that changes significantly from time to time as new
      features are added, we do not document its format and do not recommend
      that you attempt to write programs to read it directly.</para>

      <para>To assist in interchanging drawings between AutoCAD and other
      programs, a "Drawing Interchange" file format (DXF(tm)) has been
      defined.</para>

      <para>All implementations of AutoCAD accept this format and are able to
      convert it to and from their internal drawing file
      representation.</para>

      <para>AutoCAD also supports the Initial Graphics Exchange Standard
      (IGES) file format.</para>

      <para>The information comprising an AutoCAD drawing can be written out
      in IGES format, and IGES files can be read and converted to AutoCAD's
      internal format.</para>

    <section>
      <title>ASCII Drawing Interchange (DXF) Files.</title>

      <para>This section describes AutoCAD's DXF (drawing interchange) file
      format and the commands provided to read and write these files.</para>

      <para>DXF files are standard ASCII text files.</para>

      <para>They can easily be translated to the formats of other CAD systems,
      or submitted to other programs for specialized analysis.</para>

      <section>
        <title>DXFOUT Command - Writing a DXF File.</title>

        <para>You can generate a drawing interchange file from an existing
        drawing by means of the Drawing Editor's DXFOUT command.</para>

        <para>The command format is:</para>

        <programlisting>Command: DXFOUT File name &lt;default&gt;: (name or RETURN)</programlisting>

        <para>The default name for the output file is the same as that of the
        current drawing, but with a file type of ".dxf".</para>

        <para>If you specify an explicit file name, do not include a file
        type; ".dxf" is assumed.</para>

        <para>If a file with the same name already exists, it is
        deleted.</para>

        <para>Next, DXFOUT asks what precision you want for floating-point
        numbers and permits output of a partial DXF file containing only
        selected objects.</para>

        <programlisting>Enter decimal places of accuracy (0 to 16)/Entities/Binary &lt;6&gt;:</programlisting>

        <para>The "Binary" option is described later in this appendix.</para>

        <para>If you respond with "Entities" (or just "E"), DXFOUT will ask
        you to select the objects you want written to the DXF file.</para>

        <para>Only the objects you select will be included in the output file
        - symbol tables (including Block Definitions) will not be
        included.</para>

        <para>Once you've selected the desired objects, AutoCAD will prompt
        again for the numeric precision:</para>

        <programlisting>Enter decimal places of accuracy (0 to 16)/Binary &lt;6&gt;:</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>DXFIN Command - Loading a DXF File.</title>

        <para>A drawing interchange file can be converted into an AutoCAD
        drawing by means of the DXFIN command.</para>

        <para>First enter the Drawing Editor using the "Create new drawing"
        task from the Main Menu.</para>

        <para>Then issue the DXFIN command.</para>

        <programlisting>Command: DXFIN File name: (name)</programlisting>

        <para>Enter the name of the drawing interchange file to be
        loaded.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Full DXFIN.</title>

          <para>To load a complete DXF file, you must use DXFIN in an empty
          drawing, before any entities have been drawn and before any
          additional Block definitions, layers, linetypes, text styles, named
          views, named coordinate systems, or named viewport configurations
          have been created.</para>

          <para>(If your prototype draw- ing contains any such items, use Main
          Menu Task 1's "name=" technique to create a new drawing without a
          prototype.)</para>

          <para>If any errors are detected during the input, the new drawing
          is discarded.</para>

          <para>Otherwise, an automatic "ZOOM All" is performed to set the
          drawing extents.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Partial DXFIN.</title>

          <para>If the current drawing is not empty, DXFIN loads only the
          ENTITIES section of the DXF file, adding the entities found there to
          the current drawing.</para>

          <para>In this case, DXFIN displays the message:</para>

          <programlisting>Not a new drawing -- only ENTITIES section will be input.</programlisting>

          <para>If errors are detected during such partial DXF input, the
          drawing is returned to the state it was in before the DXFIN
          command.</para>

          <para>Otherwise, the newly added entities are drawn.</para>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>DXF File Format.</title>

        <para>This section describes the format of a DXF file in detail. It
        contains a great deal of technical information that you need only if
        you're writing your own program to process DXF files.</para>

        <para>Otherwise, you can skip this section.</para>

        <para>It would probably be helpful to produce a DXF file from a small
        drawing, print it out, and refer to it occasionally while reading the
        information presented below.</para>

        <section>
          <title>General File Structure.</title>

          <para>A Drawing Interchange File is simply an ASCII text file with a
          file type of ".dxf" and specially-formatted text.</para>

          <para>The overall organization of a DXF file is as follows:</para>

          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>HEADER section - General information about the drawing is
              found in this section of the DXF file.</para>

              <para>Each parameter has a variable name and an associated
              value.</para>
