    <section>
      <title>Drawing Interchange and File Formats.</title>

      <para>AutoCAD can be used by itself as a complete drawing editor.</para>

      <para>In some applications, however, other programs must examine
      drawings created by AutoCAD or generate drawings to be viewed, modified,
      or plotted with AutoCAD.</para>

      <para>For example, if you've made an architectural drawing with AutoCAD,
      using INSERTed parts to represent windows, doors, and so on, you can
      process the drawing file and produce a bill of materials of all the
      items used in the drawing, or even make energy use calculations based on
      the area and the number and type of windows used.</para>

      <para>Another possible application is to use AutoCAD to describe
      structures that are then sent to a large computer for finite element
      structural analysis.</para>

      <para>You can compute stresses and displacements and send back
      information to display the deformed structure as an AutoCAD
      drawing.</para>

      <para>Since the AutoCAD drawing database (.dwg file) is written in a
      very compact format that changes significantly from time to time as new
      features are added, we do not document its format and do not recommend
      that you attempt to write programs to read it directly.</para>

      <para>To assist in interchanging drawings between AutoCAD and other
      programs, a "Drawing Interchange" file format (DXF(tm)) has been
      defined.</para>

      <para>All implementations of AutoCAD accept this format and are able to
      convert it to and from their internal drawing file
      representation.</para>

      <para>AutoCAD also supports the Initial Graphics Exchange Standard
      (IGES) file format.</para>

      <para>The information comprising an AutoCAD drawing can be written out
      in IGES format, and IGES files can be read and converted to AutoCAD's
      internal format.</para>

    <section>
      <title>ASCII Drawing Interchange (DXF) Files.</title>

      <para>This section describes AutoCAD's DXF (drawing interchange) file
      format and the commands provided to read and write these files.</para>

      <para>DXF files are standard ASCII text files.</para>

      <para>They can easily be translated to the formats of other CAD systems,
      or submitted to other programs for specialized analysis.</para>

      <section>
        <title>DXFOUT Command - Writing a DXF File.</title>

        <para>You can generate a drawing interchange file from an existing
        drawing by means of the Drawing Editor's DXFOUT command.</para>

        <para>The command format is:</para>

        <programlisting>Command: DXFOUT File name &lt;default&gt;: (name or RETURN)</programlisting>

        <para>The default name for the output file is the same as that of the
        current drawing, but with a file type of ".dxf".</para>

        <para>If you specify an explicit file name, do not include a file
        type; ".dxf" is assumed.</para>

        <para>If a file with the same name already exists, it is
        deleted.</para>

        <para>Next, DXFOUT asks what precision you want for floating-point
        numbers and permits output of a partial DXF file containing only
        selected objects.</para>

        <programlisting>Enter decimal places of accuracy (0 to 16)/Entities/Binary &lt;6&gt;:</programlisting>

        <para>The "Binary" option is described later in this appendix.</para>

        <para>If you respond with "Entities" (or just "E"), DXFOUT will ask
        you to select the objects you want written to the DXF file.</para>

        <para>Only the objects you select will be included in the output file
        - symbol tables (including Block Definitions) will not be
        included.</para>

        <para>Once you've selected the desired objects, AutoCAD will prompt
        again for the numeric precision:</para>

        <programlisting>Enter decimal places of accuracy (0 to 16)/Binary &lt;6&gt;:</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>DXFIN Command - Loading a DXF File.</title>

        <para>A drawing interchange file can be converted into an AutoCAD
        drawing by means of the DXFIN command.</para>

        <para>First enter the Drawing Editor using the "Create new drawing"
        task from the Main Menu.</para>

        <para>Then issue the DXFIN command.</para>

        <programlisting>Command: DXFIN File name: (name)</programlisting>

        <para>Enter the name of the drawing interchange file to be
        loaded.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Full DXFIN.</title>

          <para>To load a complete DXF file, you must use DXFIN in an empty
          drawing, before any entities have been drawn and before any
          additional Block definitions, layers, linetypes, text styles, named
          views, named coordinate systems, or named viewport configurations
          have been created.</para>

          <para>(If your prototype draw- ing contains any such items, use Main
          Menu Task 1's "name=" technique to create a new drawing without a
          prototype.)</para>

          <para>If any errors are detected during the input, the new drawing
          is discarded.</para>

          <para>Otherwise, an automatic "ZOOM All" is performed to set the
          drawing extents.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Partial DXFIN.</title>

          <para>If the current drawing is not empty, DXFIN loads only the
          ENTITIES section of the DXF file, adding the entities found there to
          the current drawing.</para>

          <para>In this case, DXFIN displays the message:</para>

          <programlisting>Not a new drawing -- only ENTITIES section will be input.</programlisting>

          <para>If errors are detected during such partial DXF input, the
          drawing is returned to the state it was in before the DXFIN
          command.</para>

          <para>Otherwise, the newly added entities are drawn.</para>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>DXF File Format.</title>

        <para>This section describes the format of a DXF file in detail. It
        contains a great deal of technical information that you need only if
        you're writing your own program to process DXF files.</para>

        <para>Otherwise, you can skip this section.</para>

        <para>It would probably be helpful to produce a DXF file from a small
        drawing, print it out, and refer to it occasionally while reading the
        information presented below.</para>

        <section>
          <title>General File Structure.</title>

          <para>A Drawing Interchange File is simply an ASCII text file with a
          file type of ".dxf" and specially-formatted text.</para>

          <para>The overall organization of a DXF file is as follows:</para>

          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>HEADER section - General information about the drawing is
              found in this section of the DXF file.</para>

              <para>Each parameter has a variable name and an associated
              value.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>TABLES section -- This section contains definitions of
              named items.</para>

              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Linetype (LTYPE) table.</para>

                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para>Text style (STYLE) table.</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para>View table.</para>

                  <para>User Coordinate System (UCS) table.</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para>Viewport configuration (VPORT) table.</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para>Drawing manager (DWGMGR) table (for future
                  use).</para>
                </listitem>
              </itemizedlist>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>BLOCKS section - This section contains Block Definition
              entities describing the entities comprising each Block in the
              drawing.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>ENTITIES section - This section contains the drawing
              entities, including any Block References.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>END OF FILE.</para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>

          <para>If you use DXFOUT's "Entities" option, the resulting DXF file
          will contain only the ENTITIES and END OF FILE sections, and the
          ENTITIES section will reflect only the objects you select for
          output.</para>

          <para>A DXF file is composed of a multiplicity of groups, each of
          which occupies two lines in the DXF file.</para>

          <para>The first line of a group is a group code, which is a positive
          nonzero integer output in FORTRAN "I3" format (that is, right
          justified and blank filled in a three character field).</para>

          <para>The second line of the group is the group value, in a format
          which depends on the type of the group as specified by the group
          code.</para>

          <para>The specific assignment of group codes depends upon the item
          being described in the file.</para>

          <para>However, the type of the value this group supplies is derived
          from the group code in the following way:<table>
              <title>Group code ranges and values.</title>

          <para>Thus a program can easily read the value following a group
          code without knowing the particular use of this group in an item in
          the file.</para>

          <para>The appearance of values in the DXF file is not affected by
          the setting of the UNITS command: coordinates are always represented
          as decimal (or possibly scientific notation if very large) numbers,
          and angles are always represented in decimal degrees with zero
          degrees to the east of origin.</para>

          <para>Variables, table entries, and entities are described by a
          group that introduces the item, giving its type and/or name,
          followed by multiple groups that supply the values associated with
          the item.</para>

          <para>In addition, special groups are used for file separators such
          as markers for the beginning and end of sections, tables, and the
          file itself.</para>

          <para>Entities, table entries, and file separators are always
          introduced with a 0 group code that is followed by a name describing
          the item.</para>

          <title>Group Codes.</title>

          <para>Group codes are used both to indicate the type of the value of
          the group, as explained above, and to indicate the general use of
          the group.</para>

          <para>The specific function of the group code depends on the actual
          variable, table item, or entity description.</para>

          <para>This section indicates the general use of groups, noting as
          "(fixed)" any that always have the same function.<table>

          <title>TABLES section.</title>

          <para>The TABLES section contains several tables, each of which in
          turn contains a variable number of table entries.</para>

          <para>The order of the tables may change, but the LTYPE table will
          always precede the LAYER table.</para>

          <para>Each table is intro- duced with a 0 group with the label
          "TABLE".</para>

          <para>This is followed by a 2 group identifying the particular table
          (VPORT, LTYPE, LAYER, STYLE, VIEW, UCS, or DWGMGR) and a 70 group
          that specifies the maximum number of table entries that may
          follow.</para>

          <para>The tables in a drawing may contain deleted items, but these
          are not written to the DXF file.</para>

          <para>Thus, fewer table entries may follow the table header than are
          indicated by the 70 group, so don't use the count in the 70 group as
          an index to read in the table.</para>

          <para>It is provided so that your program to read DXF files can
          allocate an array in advance large enough to hold all the table
          entries that follow.</para>

          <para>Following this header for each table are the table
          entries.</para>

          <para>Each table item consists of a 0 group identifying the item
          type (same as table name, e.g., "LTYPE" or "LAYER"), a 2 group
          giving the name of the table entry, a 70 group specifying flags
          relevant to the table entry (defined for each table below), and
          additional groups that give the value of the table entry.</para>

          <para>The end of each table is indicated by a 0 group with the value
          "ENDTAB".</para>

          <para>If any table entry has bit value 64 set in its group 70 flags,
          the table entry was referenced by at least one entity in the drawing
          the last time the drawing editor was entered to edit this
          drawing.</para>

          <para>This "referenced" flag is for the benefit of the PURGE
          command; it can be ignored by most programs that read DXF files, and
          need not be set by programs that write DXF files.</para>

          <para>The following are the groups used for each type of table
          item.</para>

          <para>All groups are present for each table item.</para>

                  is set in the 70 group flags, this is a vertically-oriented
                  text style. A STYLE table item is used to record shape file
                  LOAD requests also. In this case the first bit (1) is set in
                  the 70 group flags and only the 3 group (shape file name) is
                  meaningful (all the other groups are output, however). The
                  "text generation flags" are a bit-coded field with the

          <para>The BLOCKS section of the DXF file contains all the Block
          Definitions.</para>

          <para>This section contains the entities that make up the Blocks
          used in the drawing, including "anonymous" Blocks generated by the
          HATCH command and by associative dimensioning.</para>

          those in the ENTITIES section described below, so refer to that
          section for details.</para>

          <para>All entities in the BLOCKS section appear between BLOCK and
          ENDBLK entities.</para>

          <para>BLOCK and ENDBLK entities appear only in the BLOCKS
          section.</para>

          <para>Block definitions are never nested (that is, no BLOCK or
          ENDBLK entity ever appears within another BLOCK-ENDBLK pair).</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>ENTITIES section.</title>

          <para>Entity items appear in both the BLOCK and ENTITIES sections of
          the DXF file.</para>

          <para>The appearance of entities in the two sections is identical,
          with the exception that entities in the BLOCK section never have
          handles.</para>

          <para>The following gives the format of each entity as it appears in
          the file.</para>

          <para>Some groups that define an entity always appear, and some are
          optional and appear only if they differ from their default
          values.</para>

          <para>In the following discussion, groups that always occur are
          given by their group number and function, while optional groups are
          indicated by "-optional N" following the group description.</para>

          <para>"N" is the default value if the group is omitted.</para>

          <para>Programs that read DXF files should not assume that the groups
          describing an entity occur in the order given here.</para>

          <para>The end of the groups that make up an entity is indicated by
          the next 0 group, beginning the next entity or indicating the end of
          the section.</para>

          <para>Remember that a DXF file is a complete representation of the
          drawing data- base, and that as AutoCAD is further enhanced, new
          groups will be added to entities to accommodate additional
          features.</para>

          <para>Writing your DXF processing program in a table-driven way,
          making no assumptions about the order of groups in an entity, and
          ignoring any groups not presently defined, will make it much easier
          to accommodate DXF files from future releases of AutoCAD.</para>

          <para>Each entity begins with a 0 group identifying the entity
          type.</para>

          <para>The names used for the entities are given in the table that
          follows.</para>

          <para>Every entity contains an 8 group that gives the name of the
          layer on which the entity resides.</para>

          <para>Each entity may have elevation, thickness, linetype, or color

                  only if 72 group is present and nonzero). The "text
                  generation flags" are a bit-coded field with mean- ings as
                  follows: Flag bit value 2 meaning "Text is backwards
                  (mirrored in X)", flag bit value 4 meaning "Text is upside
                  down (mirrored in Y)". The "justification type" value (not
                  bit-coded) indicates the text justification style used on
                  this entity, as shown in the following: value 0 meaning
                  "Text is left justified", value 1 meaning "Text is centered
                  along its baseline", value 2 meaning "Text is right
                  justified", value 3 meaning "Text is aligned between two
                  points (height varies)", value 4 meaning "Text is "middle"
                  (fully) centered", value 5 meaning "Text is fit between two
                  points (width varies)". If the justification is anything
                  other than 0 (left justified), 11, 21, and 31 groups will
                  also appear in the entity to specify the alignment point of
                  the text (center, rightmost, or second alignment point).
                  DXFOUT handles ASCII control characters in text strings by
                  expanding the character into a "^" (caret) followed by the
                  appropriate letter. For example, an ASCII Control-G (BEL,
                  decimal code 7) is output as "^G". If the text itself con-
                  tains a caret character, it is expanded to "^ " (caret,
                  space). DXFIN performs the complementary conversion.</entry>
