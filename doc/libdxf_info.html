<b><object data="libDXF-logo.svg" width="400" height="400" border="0" align="left" type="image/svg+xml"></object>libDXF is a library (written in C) with DXF related functions.
<p>
The Drawing eXchange Format (DXF) is a defacto industry standard for the exchange of drawing files between various Computer Aided Drafting programs, designed by Autodesk(TM).
<p>
Currently this project has a "Work in progress" status.<br>
<p>
The code base is still incomplete and is not debugged to an acceptable
level.<br>
<p>
You are always welcome to help with patches or bug reports :-)<br>

I write this documentation because I think, in my honest opinion, the "official" reference is incomplete, often with errors or without description, in particular the old references often change completely style and the new presents much errors and deficiencies (for example is since version u19.1.01 in 2005 that Autodesk Inc. don't changes the chapter "Revisions to the DXF Reference", and only in the year 2000 this chapter is complete and correct).<br>
I hope this work can help who want's understand how read and write a dxf, however this may not be a complete reference, due to the license with which they are distributed the "originals".<br>
Their policy is so closed that would not allow a "deep link" to the page of the dxf reference, so I can only tell you can be found on the page:<br>
