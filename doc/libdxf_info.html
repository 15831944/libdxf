<b>I write this documentation because I think, in my honest opinion, the "official" reference is incomplete, often with errors or without description, in particular the old references often change completely style and the new presents much errors and deficiencies (for example is since version u19.1.01 in February 2004 that Autodesk Inc. don't changes the chapter "Revisions to the DXF Reference", and only in the version u15.0.02 this chapter is complete and correct).<br>
I hope this work can help who want's understand how read and write a dxf, however this may not be a complete reference, due to the license with which they are distributed the "originals".<br>
Their policy is so closed that would not allow a "deep link" to the page of the dxf reference, so I can only tell you can be found on the page:<br>

The author of this documentation is Paolo Caroni (me), but the files <a href="class.html">class.html</a> and <a href="hatch.html">hatch.html</a> was written by Bert Timmerman (the author of libDXF project),<br>
the file <a href="libdxf_main.html">libdxf_main.html</a> was written by me but is only a translation in html from a txt file (written by Bert) with little change.<br>
