<h1>Introduction.</h1>
The binary file is a compressed version of the ASCII form, but occupies about 25% less.<br>
Binary is a compact format that can be written and read more quickly by computer software.<br>
Not all software can read or write the binary format of DXF.<br>
Unlike the ASCII DXF, in the binary format is impossible write a comment (group code 999).<br>
The first writable binary form is the DXF R10, first of this exist only the ASCII form.<br>
<br>
The file start olways with a header of 22 Bytes:<br>
<code>
AutoCAD Binary DXF&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;NULL&gt;
</code>
<br>
than follow the group code and the value, like the ASCII format, but rappresented in binary form:<br>
The group code is a 1 byte binary value, since R14 2 byte binary value.<br>
If the value is an integer is writed in a 2 byte integer (with the least significant byte followed by the most significant byte).<br>
If the value is an double is writed in a 8 byte IEEE form (with the least significant byte followed by the most significant byte).<br>
If the value is an string of char is writed like an ASCII string but with a &lt;NULL&gt; byte (0) at the end.<br>
<br>
Unlike the ASCII format for the extended data group codes have a 1 byte (with the value 255) pre group code, then a 2 byte integer with the correct group code, then the value.<br>
If the extended data value is a long values are a 4 bytes data.<br>
If the extended data value is a string of characters are a 1 unsigned byte, followed by the number of bytes.<br>
