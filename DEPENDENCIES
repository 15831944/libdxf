Dependencies
============

Building libdxf from scratch, either from a tarball or from the git
repository, requires (at least):

automake-1.11

autoconf-2.65

gcc-4.4.5

glibc-2.12.2

And for generating documentation:

doxygen-1.7.3

xmlto-0.0.23

and any other dependency these packages may require.

YMMV with lesser version numbers, these are the minimum versions I use to
develop libdxf with.
