libDXF is a library (written in C) with DXF related functions.

The Drawing eXchange Format (DXF) is a defacto industry standard for the exchange of drawing files between various Computer Aided Drafting programs, designed by Autodesk(TM).

Currently this project has a “Work in progress” status.
The code base is still incomplete and is not debugged to an acceptable level.

You are always welcome to help with patches or bug reports :-)
