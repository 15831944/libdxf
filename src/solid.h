 *
 * \brief Header file for a DXF solid entity (\c SOLID).
 *
 * A DXF \c SOLID entity is a filled shape made with up to four point
 * (X, Y, Z)-coordinates.\n
 * A filled triangle can be formed by duplicating the third coordinate at the
 * fourth coordinate position.\n
 * A diabolo shaped solid can be formed by "twisting" the \c SOLID form in it's
 * plane, by "swapping" the third and fourth coordinate set.
 *
 * \version According to DXF R10.
 * \version According to DXF R11.
 * \version According to DXF R12.
 * \version According to DXF R13.
 * \version According to DXF R14.
