/*!
 * \brief Definition of a DXF polyline entity.
 *
 * A polyface mesh is represented in \c DXF as a variant of a Polyline
 * entity.\n
 * The Polyline header is identified as introducing a polyface mesh by the
 * presence of the 64 bit in the Polyline flags (70) group.\n
 * The 71 group specifies the number of vertices in the mesh, and the 72
 * group, the number of faces.\n
 * While these counts are correct for all meshes created with the \c PFACE
 * command, applications are not required to place correct values in these
 * fields, and AutoCAD actually never relies upon their accuracy.\n
 * \n
 * Following the Polyline header is a sequence of Vertex entities that
 * specify the vertex coordinates and faces that compose the mesh.\n
 * Vertices such as these are described in the following subsection on
 * Vertex.\n
 * \n
 * Applications might want to represent polygons with an arbitrarily large
 * number of sides in polyface meshes.\n
 * However, the AutoCAD entity structure imposes a limit on the number of
 * vertices that a given face entity can specify.\n
 * You can represent more complex polygons by decomposing them into
 * triangular wedges.\n
 * Their edges should be made invisible to prevent visible artifacts of this
 * subdivision from being drawn.\n
 * The \c PFACE command performs this subdivision automatically, but when
 * applications generate polyface meshes directly, the applications must do
 * this themselves.\n
 * \n
 * The number of vertices per face is the key parameter in this subdivision
 * process.\n
 * The \c PFACEVMAX system variable provides an application with the number
 * of vertices per face entity.\n
 * This value is read-only, and is set to 4.\n
 * \n
 * Polyface meshes created with the \c PFACE command are always generated
 * with all the vertex coordinate entities first, followed by the face
 * definition entities.\n
 * The code within AutoCAD that processes polyface meshes does not, at
 * present, require this ordering; it works even with interleaved vertex
 * coordinates and face definitions as long as no face specifies a vertex
 * with an index that appears after it in the database.\n
 * Programs that read polyface meshes from \c DXF would be wise to be as
 * tolerant of odd vertex and face ordering as AutoCAD is.\n
 *
 * \version According to DXF R10.
 * \version According to DXF R11.
 * \version According to DXF R12.
 * \version According to DXF R13.
 * \version According to DXF R14.
