 * \brief Header file for a DXF insert entity (\c INSERT).
 *
 * A DXF \c INSERT entity is an insertion for a (external) \c BLOCK entity.\n
 * Whilst a \c BLOCK only resides in the block table only once as a
 * definition, an \c INSERT entity can insert blocks as singlular entities
 * and also as [rectanglar, polar] arrays in the drawing.
