    for version R14.
    Implementing the start of application-defined group "{application_name", with Group code 102.
    For example: "{ACAD_REACTORS" indicates the start of the AutoCAD persistent reactors group.

    application-defined codes: Group codes and values within the 102 groups are application defined (optional).

Global dxf_viewport::frozen_layers [DXF_MAX_LAYERS]
    Implement the number of layers in a more efficient way.
    A lot of memory is consumed by reserving for DXF_MAX_LAYERS instead of the actual existing number of layers.
    Maybe this can be solved by dynamically allocating a reasonable number of layers during compile time, and (re-allocating) shrinking when the actual number of layers is known during run time.
